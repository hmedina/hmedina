- 👋 Hi, I’m Hector Medina (@hmedina)
- 👀 I’m interested in using detailed descriptions of biochemical signaling cascades to learn the whys, hows, wheres, of cellular decision making. My PhD project used the [Kappa language](https://github.com/Kappa-Dev/KappaTools), for which I helped develop a few tools in Python and OCaml to analyze a very large mechanistic model of canonical Wnt signaling. As my research has gone into phase separations & aggregation, I am very interested in exploring their regulation in a systematic & quantitative fashion. I also have an interest in synthetic biology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, originally to write a fast simulator tailored to a specific question from my research.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the wet or dry characterization & control of cellular decision making via the targeted & individualized regulation of cellular aggregates, be it in a pharmacology approach, more industrial bioengineering, or even a more outlandish synthetic biology context.
